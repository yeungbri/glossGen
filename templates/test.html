<!--
  DO NOT SIMPLY COPY THOSE LINES. Download the JS and CSS files from the
  latest release (https://github.com/enyo/dropzone/releases/latest), and
  host them yourself!

<p>
  This is the most minimal example of Dropzone. The upload in this example
  doesn't work, because there is no actual server to handle the file upload.

<!-- Change /upload-target to your upload address -->
<form action="/upload-target" class="dropzone"></form>
